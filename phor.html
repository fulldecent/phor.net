    Phor.net started in the late 90's a couple days after I first asked the question, what is this "Linux" thing I keep hearing about? This is my internet playground. Originally this site was used as a massive piracy effort and has, over time, evolved into a not massive piracy effort.

    Originally, the site was a searchable list of MP3's. This is obviously long before anyone had used the term "internet piracy" to describe what I used to call "sharing music online like it's my job". After that I hosted some even hotter content, the solutions to high school level textbook homework. Everyone hated doing this homework and I had the teachers manual online. Well, one kid started talking to another, and the site became popular. Then the publisher found out and that was a mess. While what I was doing was strictly legal, I didn't have the resources to defend myself.

    At about the same time I decided that maybe hosting vocabulary homework answers is not worth harassing phone calls, I had amassed a 100% complete collection of game ROMS for every Nintendo game ever released in any country ever. Clearly, this was also hosted on the site as well. The next few months were a little blurry, but after that I was receiving over a million web site hits a month from Japan and Alexa ranked phor.net as one of the top 50,000 websites on the internet.

    After all of the illegitimate distribution concluded, I started learning how to make cool websites. The first of which, titled Developer Life (now Source Speak), was a way to distribute source code online so I could make cool printouts for class. This was written in bash since that was the first scripting language I learned really well. If you don't know what bash is, just pretend I said "I did something utterly embarrassing, and it's crazy that I'm even writing this down".

    Now the site lists my resume, and active projects. Bonus for people who read this page: all the embarassing and interesting stuff on this site is hidden in HTML comments.
