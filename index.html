            - Lead author of ERC-721 / the standard for tracking physical assets on Ethereum. I have studied many practical issues related to tracking and transferring ownership/custody/risk of assets and recording these to a ledger. All relevant projects, to date, have adopted this standard.

            - Founder of Su Squares / a scaleable blockchain project. This simple project, named after my wife, is a bunch of cute squares that you can buy and personalize. But also it is a project that demonstrates scaleable concepts (millions, trillions, sextillions of assets) on the public blockchain.
            - Contributor to Solidity / the language used for Hyperledger, POA and Ethereum networks. I contribute to the language design of the programming language used for developing smart contracts.

            SUCCESSFUL OUTREACH FOR ONE CLIENT
            * I have audited the MLB Crypto Baseball project (now MLB Champions) -- this included 30 findings ranging from advisory to material -- client allows me to say this but has not yet published that report* I reviewed the prerelease version of 0xcert Framework v1 -- client wished to make all issues public so the report is just a listing (attached)* I have reported a vulnerability against Aion (steal any token) -- https://github.com/jennijuju/ATS_CI/pull/2/files* I am an author of ERC-165 and a last-call reviewer of ERC-1167, both used here* Other than blockchain, I am credited with vulnerability findings against: Apple.com store homepage, a stock brokerage, Penna. business tax records. All posted at https://privacylog.blogspot.com. I also published the first zero-day on Slashdot.
