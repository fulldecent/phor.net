DOUCHE VERSION

<p class="lead">Corporate acquisition experience in valuation, business planning, and integration with a diverse engineering/finance background. Research interests in data mining and information theory.</p>

SUPER DOUCHE VERSION

William Entriken is an experienced financial professional who understands M&A, business, and technology concepts and goes that extra step to deliver increased sales or process transformations. William is currently a Senior Financial Analyst at a publicly-traded integrated engineering and technology services organization. William has responsibility for the budget and forecasting process & systems for the $1bn company, valuation of business segments, and leading technology initiatives to improve finance processes. From 2002 to 2006, William started a consulting business to create websites for clients with experience in branding, referral business, and sale of digital products, as well as collaboration with government agencies to secure online vulnerabilities - successfully paying for college. William's formal education includes a three-summer engineering apprenticeship with the U.S. Navy for ship system programming, a B.S. Computer and Electrical Engineering from Villanova, and a M.S. Finance and MBA dual masters from Drexel University.

WILLIAM ENTRIKEN. Blockchain developer contributing to the Ethereum project focused on language design, interoperability and ERC-721. Also working on corporate development and security research.

THE 0XCERT VERSION

William is a remarkable thinker and a technological leader, an Ethereum blockchain developer and the lead author of ERC-721, which is a technological standard interface protocol for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds. He is a passionate computer science professional who is helping to bring technology products to market. He has experience in business planning and acquisitions, and is active in researching several computer science topics. As the Non Fungibles has been identified as the new driver behind the Blockchain revolution, first example of this are everyone’s favourite CryptoKitties, his fame is rising rapidly and has gained on GitHub, home of more than 20 million developers from all over the world, a cult status.

MORE SPEAKER BIOS
- Lead author of ERC-721 / the standard for tracking physical assets on Ethereum. I have studied many practical issues related to tracking and transferring ownership/custody/risk of assets and recording these to a ledger. All relevant projects, to date, have adopted this standard.
- Event organizer of Chain 76 / a conference and hands-on workshop for pharmaceuticals, supply chain, and blockchain. This event focused on drug serialization, GxP, DSCSA, and drew a great audience from Phila/NYC area, including people here. (Thank you!)
- Founder of Su Squares / a scaleable blockchain project. This simple project, named after my wife, is a bunch of cute squares that you can buy and personalize. But also it is a project that demonstrates scaleable concepts (millions, trillions, sextillions of assets) on the public blockchain.
- Contributor to Solidity / the language used for Hyperledger, POA and Ethereum networks. I contribute to the language design of the programming language used for developing smart contracts.

William Entriken - Advisor to 0xcert and Independent Blockchain Developer. He is the lead author of ERC-721 which is a technological standard protocol for tracking persons' identity and ownership of physical assets. He currently works at Pacific Medical Training and previously worked for Google, the United States Navy, and public and private engineering companies in the defense and research sector.

FRENCH FOUNDERS INTRO
William Entriken advises Arianee, EY and other clients working on enterprise blockchain applications. He is the lead author of the Ethereum standard for tracking physical assets (ERC-721) and he works with a passion for reducing fraud in commerce and improving the value of brands.

SUCCESSFUL OUTREACH FOR ONE CLIENT
* I have audited the MLB Crypto Baseball project (now MLB Champions) -- this included 30 findings ranging from advisory to material -- client allows me to say this but has not yet published that report* I reviewed the prerelease version of 0xcert Framework v1 -- client wished to make all issues public so the report is just a listing (attached)* I have reported a vulnerability against Aion (steal any token) -- https://github.com/jennijuju/ATS_CI/pull/2/files* I am an author of ERC-165 and a last-call reviewer of ERC-1167, both used here* Other than blockchain, I am credited with vulnerability findings against: Apple.com store homepage, a stock brokerage, Penna. business tax records. All posted at https://privacylog.blogspot.com. I also published the first zero-day on Slashdot.
