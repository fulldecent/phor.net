Specifically, his thesis is that throughout biology, computing, physics, weather and other sciences, there are behaviors that are considered complex and that these complex behaviors can be modeled by using simple models in large scales. One telling example is when he models fluid dynamics, a field generally dominated by differential equations, with a simple bouncing particles approach. I'm not going to lie, I was upset to read 70% through the book and find that the book ended with 200 pages remaining of notes and bibliography.

More than a couple people recommended this book, and I anticipated a big hit since it is based on a code and apparently there's a big twist. What I liked were the bite sized chapters and a couple of the foreshadowing hooks. Other than that the story is hardly noteworthy, another waste of my time. Brown clearly capitalizes on the inquisitive public and skepticism of the Catholic church. The \"big twist\", was hardly worth reading up to, aside from the massive plot hole. I do laud the attempt to bring some historically buried facts into light, though."

There are also a nice set of moral evaluation tools in here that let you evaluate situations. These ultimately showed me that a few of my beliefs were inconsistent.

Since their government will become corrupt to game the system, this results in people being worse off than they were before the foreign aid. The solution is to promote causes that the people think are important and to monitor and hold accountable the agencies that intend to solve specific problems. There were a lot of good arguments in the book and I have come to agree with the thesis. (Older and wiser, a note from 3/25/2009: Human aid is a big task, gifting money and resources is not scalable, private enterprise is scalable, therefore private enterprise is the appropriate format to effect human aid.)"

Unfortunately, I have read several books by mathematicians and they are all identical. I will save you the time of reading this or any other of them: fibonacci has a series of numbers, things get large when you exponentiate, adjacent spirals on a sunflower have sizes that are proportional at a ratio called phi. Like other \"math people\" books, this one butchers mathematical ideas by trying to make them accessible to a larger audience. Mathematics is a system of patterns and analogies. People that have these models in their repertoire can use them to understand new things. However it is useless to make these obscure analogies accessible to lay people; it would be better to describe new ideas directly. A person with a background in math will enjoy a good laugh on how he shoehorns Wolfram's cellular automata to describing investor sentiments (pp170-171). You can read it by searching for \"stephen wolfram\" of the \"Search Inside this book\" feature on Amazon. (Older and wiser, a note from 3/25/2009: The counter point to the author, who expects uninteresting results in the future, is simply to read Black Swan -- also on this list. Another note, the only useful sentence in this book, which is basically a footnote is wedged between pages 182-183.)"

    "notes": "This book makes the point that Greenspan has done America a disservice by consistently setting the Federal Funds Rate too low. The effect was that too much money was being deployed and bubbles formed. My favorite Volcker quote is in there: the fate of the world economy is now fully dependent on the growth of the U.S. economy, which is dependent on the stock market, whose growth is dependent on about 50 stocks, half of which have never reported on earnings. This book also makes some misleading uses of number like this: \"... was an annualized rate of 44 percent over the last 10 weeks of the year.\" For comparison, the S and P 500 went down an annualized 99.98% over the past day, (August 7, 2008). So overall what it comes down to is: did we over allocate resources to tech stocks from 1998-2001. As you answer this, you should look at a graph of the NASDAQ from 1990 to 2010. My answer is maybe a little bit, but not that much. When you think of how your life has changed during 1999 and 2000 as a result of the internet, I think it's quite reasonable to say \"this is the point when everything changed.\" And if you are going to misallocate capital, that is the perfect time to. However, after 2001 I agree with the author that money was too available, which resulted in a real estate and commodity bubble afterwards -- which was completely unfounded and delayed a much needed recession. (Older and wiser, a note from 4/14/2009: Of course, the solution is that interest rates should not be centrally planned.)"

Nevertheless, this book was recommended to me by Ron Blankenhorn as still relevant, and I trust his opinion. This book discuses the mechanics of successfully starting and eventually selling a high tech business. Quick fact: being the CEO of a high tech startup is less tiring than running a growing division at a large, public company. The book thoroughly discusses business plans and projection. Of course it boils down to the same lesson in business school: accounting numbers are useless, only cash matters. Another interesting thing about the book is that it discusses the relationships between all the parties, investors, VCs, management, lawyers, landlords, and it explains all the gotchas in dealing with those parties. Highly recommended for someone making deals, or starting a company."

Some themes from the book are: U.S. GDP data is grossly inflated, a housing bubble will soon collapse, and America is way over-leveraged. The most valuable part of this book is an illustration of civil unrest in America, and a very skeptical view of government. These aspects are all useful.

    "notes": "Just to start off, here is Will's stance on foreign policy: the less you try to change others the cheaper your relationships will be to maintain. This book supports the argument that there is a large and effective community of American voters who make Israel their first priority, and due to their influence, elected officials in America commit unconditional support to the country. Then the book goes on to explain how this is against America and Israel's best interests. In addition to the arguments that any libertarian or atheist would appreciate, the book responds to the question \"is Israel an asset or liability to America\". Mearsheimer enumerates instances where Israel has been of limited utility to the US when they wanted to use the state for military purposes if those purposes had not directly and immediately benefitted Israel. As to whether terrorist sentiment towards the US is related to America's support of Israel, the book refers the reader to a letter from Ramzi Yousef to the New York Times after he bombed the World Trade Center: \"We declare our responsibility for the explosion on the mentioned building. This action was done in response for the American political, economical, and military support to Israel, the state of terrorism, and to the rest of the dictator countries in the region.\" [Will's note] here is a related quote from Osama Bin Laden on Sept. 14, 2009 titled \"A statement to the American people:\" \"The reason for our dispute with you is your support for your ally Israel, occupying our land in Palestine.\" -- The book makes a poor case for quantifying the cost in dollars of America's direct support for Israel. After such a powerful book and argument, I was disappointed to lay eyes on a modern topic involving a price tag of only a few billions of dollars. For the future, I would like recommendations on counter arguments to this book, preferably matching this book point for point."

Nothing in this book is crazy useful for me or expands beyond what David Allen already made obvious, but it does touch on my general interest in post industrial revolution and post internet age anthropology/sociology. Specifically, how does human life change when productivity increases so that every one can eat and have shelter with only 3% of the population employed to enable this? This book in question points to a great quote in 1959 Harvard Business Review, \"boredom, which used to bother only aristocrats [will] become a common curse,\" and then tries to argue this is not the case. Chapter six does give more hard numbers and anecdotes from various sources to show how life has changed over the past 50 years.

    "notes": "The main argument is: human diet and activities have changed much recently compared to our tried and true upbringings since divergence from the apes (~6m yrs ago) and obesity, lethargy, and other ailments have ensued. Recent dietary changes include popularization of agriculture/grains (10k yrs ago), plant engineering (2k yrs ago), added sugar craze (100 yrs ago), genetics/pesticides/hormones/antibiotics/artificials (60 yrs ago), increased transportation/shelf life of food (30 yrs ago). Recent changes in activity include popularization of not having hunt for food (12,000 yrs ago), machines/bikes/cars (200 yrs ago), TV (60 yrs ago), anti-sunlight/anti-social machines (20 yrs ago). Obviously all these things are working against our health and the book gives you lists of changes to go back to primal living and avoid modern ailments like diabetes, obesity, and fatigue. I think the real arguments to be had are \"do the internet, soda, and all this fake food really cause the modern whole new category of diabetes?\" and \"how many humans would fit on Earth if we were all eating real food like plants and animals?\""

    "notes": "With the limitation of having sources and notes for all facts in the book, Morris does a remarkable job of turning Teddy Roosevelt's life, from a pile of correspondence, diaries, and errata, into a lively story. He has no problem pulling in geographical and weather facts as they add color, including detailed description of a weather event that is a turning point in TR's life -- which was written as a perfectly executed interlude. Teddy is the man's man with hunting, travel, taxonomy and cowboy stories and there are great nuggets of insult \"[they're a] bunch of shrill eunuchs,\" \"[they are] logical vegetarians of the flabbiest type,\" \"they never open their mouths without subtracting from the sum of human knowledge,\" and in declining a funeral invitation of a political enemy, \"but that does not mean to say I do not heartily approve of it.\" \nThis is a volume on TR's life before presidency and it touches on the events that shaped his attitude, a father that gave quick and certain punishment for \"selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness\", family, accomplices. Aside from the meaty story of bravery, suave, physical feats, there are plenty of tricks and social techniques shown, the Russian negotiator (p243), how to call a bluff (p281), running the press (p502), playing both sides of the aisle (p524), kissing ass (p607). In addition to the story of a great republican, it was interesting to read a history of politics, showing for sure that certain parts of the fight never change."

In fact, the more they are tested the stronger they get. A clay pot doesn't get better; after so much testing it will break. The book categorizes things by whether they benefit from being shook up. It is quite roundabout for being \"just\" a definition of a concept. Throughout the book it is taking street smart concepts of trust and skin in the game and breaking down explanations for things that you basically know already but don't know how you know. Applying to the modern world, there are callouts of who are exploiting the innocent and how to avoid being a sucker in a world of sharks."

The similarity to Hawking's book is perhaps immodest. The original translations are included verbatim with introductions from Hawking. With time, these texts have gained notoriety however the translations have not been updated. I /hate/ seeing typos and errors in math texts and manuals. Unlike some other reviewers my goal was to read this book entirely and not wince. Cantor was interesting to read while remembering the \"refutations\" kids often have to him when starting their math learning.

    "notes": "Robert Gates is a capable writer, able to easily take the storyline of his time as Secretary of Defense and separate it into themes each with their own timelines while maintaining a flow that helps illustrate the complexities of the role. Gates gives an interesting and close look into largest employer in the world by sharing senior tactical decisions used to support the mission. The many interactions discussed let you see how responsibility, accountability and military authorization are shared between bureaucrats and legislators and generals and lower officers. There is also a great amount of information and opinions about some our foreign relations with some friends (Russia?, Saudi Arabia, Israel?) and enemies (Pakistan). A close attention to timing and geography in the book, which includes many such details, versus the names and military ranks mentioned may even provide an unintentional disclosure of military capabilities of the US and other countries.\n Gates seems to take a reformer's attitude, while understanding that the legislature is required to make real change. While bemoaning lawmakers who vote on defense only to bring spending to their states, \"Congress is best viewed from a distance\". He carried out a \"'zero-based' review of all Defense intelligence missions, organizations, relationships, and contracts\" where each program should fight based on its own merits not because it already exists. However, he fails to present a zero-based strategy of US military involvement and instead defers to vague notions such as \"we cannot afford to lose\" or consequences will be huge like last time. His leadership of the CIA and experience with the Cold War and past US involvement in the Middle East is presented sparingly to help justify why the wars were maintained.\n For his first post-career memoir and for his level of experience, I was surprised to find a lack of candor in questioning the strategy and his uppers. For example, while specific senators are called out for defending wasteful in-state military spending (Patty Murray, Bill Young) he fails to discuss any perceived conflicts of interest from Dick Cheney favoring a pre-emptive first strike on Syria. Perhaps this is part of making sure the troops \"didn't do it for nothing\" that he asks of Bush's and Obama's speeches. I was also surprised in a lack of discussion of oil. I don't know anything about the influence of oil on the US's military decisions, but for a book over 600 pages focused on the middle east, it was interesting their major feature, oil, is mentioned only four times in passing. Another omission lies in this quote \"the [Iraq] war will always be tainted by the harsh reality that the public premise for invasion ... was wrong\" (p 569), emphasis on the word public.\n "

    "notes": "This second installment on Roosevelt's life focuses on his US presidency during the years 1901 to 1907. The story details the political feats of a president who succeeded in handling labor and combination domestic issues as well as successful negotiation of the Panama canal against an extorting local government. However, Morris' detailed account into Roosevelt's correspondence and relationships gives new themes and uses for the book. Diplomatic protocols, strategic personal correspondence (p. 692, to Alice), press relations, posterity letters, and personal ethics are all presented in such detail that you could use this book as a guide on each of these topics. Aside from political clout, it is interesting to look at Roosevelt as a man. His success in arbitrating the end of the Russo-Japanese War and the Coal Strike of 1902 were both attributed to his presidency; however, they were won both by the parties' testament to and reliance on Roosevelt's personal ethics. Overall it is great to learn more about this president with long-lasting impacts and a great understanding of naval strategy before America's rise from 5th largest naval fleet to first, especially in this year which will end the 100-year streak of America leading as the world's largest GDP (by PPP).\n "

Ignoring all the lessons and only comparing the descriptions of who's who versus today, it is interesting to see how little has changed in the investment/speculation business over the years. All this regardless of ever more regulation, Kelly criterion, modern portfolio theory, BlackâScholes, financial engineering, and much faster access to information. Charlie Munger might say: human intuition, save its self-defeatism, will produce better decisions than even tomorrow's financial theory.\n The major theme of the book is \"croupiers get paid, but everyone else on Wall Street is out to get themselves,\" coupled with \"nobody just wants to be the croupier.\" \n Over and over there are tales of greed and inflated self-worth conspiring to make people purchase risky assets on credit. This same description is used for most everybody. And quite simply the only constructive advice is to avoid buying on credit.\n "

    "notes": "This is the final part in Morris' trilogy depicting the life of Theodore Roosevelt. There are several angles from which to read this book: the story of a man, a historical timepiece, or a guidebook in high-level leadership. On the first two counts, this installment fails to live up to TR's earlier years. Spoilers abound: he travels and meets people, he doesn't get a third term, the progressive party fails to launch, we win the war after a late entry. Because of the fast onset of Roosevelt's political impotency, there is not much story you can hope for while reading. To consider the last angle, Morris' analysis and illustration always exhibit the insight and access that are necessary for high-level leadership. I'll touch on just two items here. Teddy has access to an extensive network of confidents which report to him popular sentiment and the official and unofficial working of countries across the world. He maintained this by extensive writing, and has perhaps \"written more than other man in the United States\" including 150,000 letters between 1898 and 1915. This access, and his insight, allowed Roosevelt to predict a war and really understand the direction of the countries in the world. Compared to nowadays, teenagers often have friends in other countries or at least people that they idolize or follow. And most today working in an office will send at least that many letters. With only insight, Twitter, and email, anybody is able to be as informed, prepared for the world, and able to understand the tensions in the world as Roosevelt did. Lastly Roosevelt's strong personal ethics are shown strong as ever throughout the book. A patriot signs himself and his sons up for war first. Use your energy propulsively. Read extensively and connect with them to grow knowledge together.\n "

    "notes": "This book is required reading for value investing and includes detailed discussion on portfolio management, human discipline and stock selection. On portfolio management, Benjamin Graham recommends a minimum of 25% allocation in the asset class (equity or bonds) opposite of where you want to invest. In discipline, he says to consider the risk \"if there is a fair possibility that the holder may have to sell at a time when the price is well below cost.\" Since Graham's time, we now have access to myriad investment funds with neglegible fees supporting nearly any investment hypothesis. It is nearly certain that in todayâs environment, Graham would recommend this investment plan for almost everyone.\nGraham gives active (\"enterprising\") stock pickers a plan to improve their stock returns by 5% before tax (p 34) versus indexes, but says this requires significant analysis. Donât expect to make business profits (above market) from securities unless you have business-level knowledge of them. Napkin math says you need 10 years of your salary saved before this is worthwhile. And that was before your competition had calculators, let alone computers, high frequency trading and relaxed insider trading prosecution. But, you are probably reading this book because you want to beat the market or think you are special.\nGrahamâs approach to analysis and valuation is interesting and useful â and it predates modern portfolio theory and the capital asset pricing model. Graham uses several metrics I have not seen in other modern textbooks including earnings/book (surprisingly resilient over the years), an emphasis on total capitalization in company ratios and showing annual stock prices as high/low ranges. With an investment horizon of 50 years, it is very appropriate to take a look at state-of-the-art analysis from about 50 years ago! Grahamâs approach to accounting for warrants is to increase the market capitalization which in turn increases the price per share for common. \nAccording to Graham, good equity selection is a matter of finding a company with a strong financial position and the prospect for maintained future earnings which is priced close to its asset value and a safe multiple of earnings. Various litmus tests are provided for a strong financial position: a prominent brand with revenue somewhere near Fortune 500; 10+ years with no earnings deficit; 2+ current ratio; minimize over the past 10 years the maximum drop in EPS vs each's prior three years; long term debt less than equity at book (industrials) or less than 2x equity at book (utilities); 20+ years of continuous dividend payments; clear policy of 66% dividend payout ratio or demonstration that retained earnings increases per-share earnings. Also, there are tests for fair equity pricing: price less than net working capital minus debt (if possible); price less than earnings multiples of stocks with expected growth; price less than 1.33 times book value of equity. For bond selection, 7-year average earnings before tax divided by (fixed charge + 2x preferred) is recommended to exceed: 4+ (public utility), 5+ (railroad, retail), 7+ industrial.\nOverall, this has been a great starting point for someone interested in investing and stock selection. In modern times you must also consider pension liabilities and special purpose entities because they carry off-balance-sheet claims on future earnings. The additions in the revised edition by Zweig add 60% more text to the book and very little additional insight. \n ",

True to form, it fails to make any noticeable contribution to economic thought. The main thesis of the book is that market economies incentivize products for poor decision makers. You know you are reading a terrible book when the afterword is dedicated to defending that its thesis even exists or is new, \"we will now describe three ways in which this book presents a perspective that is, quite possibly, novel relative to current economics.\" It also falls into the coulda/woulda/shoulda trap with \"had we economists appropriately seen free markets as a two-edged sword, we would all but surely have delved into the ways in which financial derivatives and mortgage-backed securities, and also sovereign debt, would turn out badly.\" Statements like this are useless, only with time machines is hindsight profitable. Foresight is valuable, it should only be necessary for the authors to tell us how much they bet and profited from these thoughts. As an adult, it was painful to read such an obvious analysis of the result when people with different motives come together. However, I do think this book would be a great study of critical thinking for children before the age of maturity."

This book collects essays written between 1920 and 1950 in an interesting format designed to make the case for socialism in the United States. Its author then went on to found The Monthly Review, the most successful socialist periodical in the United States till this day.\n\nAt that time, there was a notable chance of socialism taking hold in the United States and across the world. This comprised the Red Scare and included support from academics. I think the ideas in this book are very relevant to the United States and world relations in 2016, especially with the current topics in the presidential debates and with the advent of Brexit.\n\nThe way this book makes its point is very interesting. The author collects several recent published articles and adds a few of his own, then updates the wording for consistency. This is much better executed than the failure that was Stephen Wolfram's A New Kind of Science.\n\nOverall, I was very interested to understand the 1950s perspective on what is socialism. People use this word frequently in the US presidential debates and when discussing other countries but it is nice to go back to the original values and understand what the movement originally wanted. Perhaps the most valuable result of economic discourse is to compare societies and to understand their values."

Summary of Hindu understanding of the self: humans have body, mind and consciousness; body has needs; mind is limited; humans instinctively believe all three constitute the \"self\"; this motivates the consciousness to preserve the body. Once you understand that actually only consciousness is the self, then all of your subjective values become objective. This is book is an objective study of the values that you already knew. In other words, it is a reconstruction of the human value system using consciousness rather than intuition."

    "notes": "This is a metaphysics book, it concerns the subjective (conscious) self and the objective universe. Any meditation and learning about the self is knowledge (pure truth, cannot be improved). But any layers and levels (mithyÄ) of labels we use to describe the universe is necessarily an approximation, and further, void of any actual existence. Then the reduction is explained in full force! The pure way to understand the subjective self is that it excludes your physical body, the chemicals inside you and your thoughts â the same self is in the real world and in the dream world â and therefore it transcends both. This also means that consciousness is a unitary entity â and The Consciousness in you is the same that is in other people and things that have self awareness. Reduction also applies to the objective universe! Truly exists not your sensing of the world, nor the things in the world, nor the molecules, nor atoms, nor particles â existence applies in our universe as well as any possible universe â and therefore it transcends them. This means that existence is also a unitary entity â and The Existence in these particles the same that is everywhere a time and a space are involved."

It starts with the motivation for starting a new country, the Declaration of Independence, and then proceeds through the Constitution. Basic ELI5 commentary is given for each article and amendment. This would make a great substitute for a child's civics class -- of course no child would take an interest in reading this book. The author makes very clear that his favorite amendment was the fourteenth. Upon closer inspection, I found the 'nor shall any State deprive' part applies to 'any person', and this is corroborated in 1 U.S. Code Â§ 8. I did not previously know that the Constitution guaranteed rights to non-citizens. My understanding of world events makes me believe less in the Constitution's standing in this regard. And finally, I find the author's understanding of the tenth amendment very limited."

This wasn't on my high school's required reading list (maybe it was, I didn't read books in high school), but this is clearly a classic. The storytelling is good. If the definition of storytelling is setting up expectations and then breaking those expectations then this story delivers because of how it introduces the characters and even the smaller characters have real depth which lead to conflicts. The book isn't contrived with added details to make it louder than necessary. // The story is about the fast life and some decisions that put the squeeze on Slim. Maybe pimping itself is less prevalent today since we have other ways to get the fix -- but I think human nature does not change, so it is interesting to see the unique people in this life and wonder what the same people would be doing if born in a different place and time."

Maybe sociology research in nature can inspire products and systems that require interconnectivity and collective decisionmaking. It seems like there is much more research to do in this field. I'd be interested to read more about attacks on the honeybees. Maybe other bee species deter honeybees from entering a potential site when there is competition. Maybe predators somehow attract honeybees. Or maybe in a place with limited nesting sites, a rival colony will infiltrate neighbors and trick them to selecting inferior sites, leaving the good ones for the spy colony."

This book comes in a slightly different style, and it is from a different voice, the voice of White Folks. But it uses Slim's literary devices (foreshadowing, word choice, detail level). The story is good and, dare I say, informative. I have seen some scams in life and it is interesting to see the other side of these stories. Of course this is just a small slice and there are a lot more stories to tell. I am seeing a theme between this book and the original Slim is substance abuse.

Then add a few specific rules -- like don't allow anybody to unilaterally make committments on the team until the next progress report iteration, and workers must regularly forecast if their committed work will be complete by progress report day instead of waiting until that day. Now you have a very usable team dynamic, which is roughly implemented in all modern product development teams. By using the same framework, even across product types, we can now easily describe these processes and learn together."

I would have been more interested in a call-to-arms which invited participation and hoped to actually produce solve the identified problems. The book recommends reading other people's code as a way to learn -- good advice. In general, the author eschews NPM, running other people's code without reading it, and fully documenting code; but surely he does not audit the JavaScript runtime, the operating system, or the processor running underneath.

There is much to say on whether he did the right thing and I have a whole blogging website about privacy, but that's a discussion, here this is just a book review. Snowden explains how and why the U.S. government hacks/infiltrates/coerces U.S. technology providers to provide full access to all details/papers/effects of every American's life and keeps it permanently (among other things). ETHICS. Whenever a person takes big and new action which is guided by their morals, we like to read about the origin and development of these morals, it tests us. This book mostly delivers â Snowden the character is developed and we can see how love of the U.S. constitution and a sense of duty to the people, mixed with opportunity, delivered his outcome. Soldiers risk life and limb to protect the American people, so while reading this book you need to ask would they or you do like Snowden did if you had the chance? The book explains most of the ethics and background for you to relate and answer this question. One part that is missing â and I know this sounds stupid â is the explanation of why he bothered to pick up and read the constitution in the first place. Not everybody is civic-minded, and not everybody understands change, idealism and opposition to authority. True patriotism is more than identifying your team and wearing the team colors, it requires knowing and loving your country so well that you would recognize it at another place and time. These explanations are missing and so the full ethical story might be inaccessible to some people. TECHNOLOGY. The book explains enough for anybody to understand what happened and the systems and parts that worked together to do it. STYLE. The prose is mostly open and matter-of-fact. Even at times a fact is included or a tangent is presented at the expense of an important point being made. These informalities make the text relatable. At other times, the text reads slightly guarded. Words are carefully chosen \"I could have,\" or \"I would have\" versus \"I did.\" Don't break the law when you're breaking the law. Confessing to any other crimes may have detracted from the main message, but the guardedness is visible. CALLS TO ACTION. Reading a book is an investment and if it doesn't change your life it's a loss. Maybe the actions we can take reading this book are to relate to geeky technology people, or approve Snowden's actions, or refine our own ethics, or reform governments everywhere, or contribute to the next generation of tools he is developing for privacy. Maybe the most alarming statament he made is that he could access the personal emails and more of the justices of the U.S. supreme court without a warrant. That is a very specific claim aimed at a very specific, and small group of people. You need a bigger scandal to make the public react. As Snowden himself says, it is not enough to lay out the facts; you must stick around to help your audience with interpreting them. Also he could have been more specific about asking for others to support his cause. While calling out Bush and Obama, with repeats, for supporting unconstitutional surveilance and other crimes, he fails to make a specific case for 45 to take action. And he also fails to make the case for a specific whistleblower, someone that has a specific access he does not. Somebody has access to the search logs and knows whether an agent did in fact access supreme court justice private information, or tap attorney-client priviledged communications for a defendant against a federal prosecution, or whether a specific group of people, say blacks, or civil rights proponents, were targeted for parallel construction of minor drug offenses. Snowden could have explained his ethics up-front on whether the person who does have access to that information should make it public."

    "notes": "This is the source reference for most productivity software and websites. When Google is making your email client or someone is making your project management software for your phone... those people read this book and are trying to bring that philosophy to you. The main discipline in this book is: when you are in triage mode, everything less than 2 minutes of work gets done now and everything else goes into a system, and each thing only touches your triage mode once. In this millennium, we have from to a stream of email (that's old) to a deluge of text messages and Slack messages, and most people I know now don't even notice or care what is in their email. So one important modern discipline is missing from this book: keep good relationships with your contacts and set standards with them about what channels they should reach you at regarding actionable items."

The good parts of this book are the UV gloss overlay on the dust cover, extra bright white paper and use of two colors in text. Now to the bad parts -- the words in the book, the lack of a references or notes section (we've researched \"[thousands] of scholarly articles...\" see it on our website), and then their website which of course is yet another subscription service."

      "dateread": "September 2020",
      "notes": "Gates opens up by lamenting how US presidents are quick to rely the military as their primary instrument of power when they want to exert influence outside their country. Then examples are developed on a country-by-country/region basis, across post-cold-war presidents on how they have balanced military and non-military instruments of power. He is authoritative on the topic and this surely brings a great study of the past for future executive leaders. Each example lays out how the conflict played out and how we might rebalance to have non-military initiatives play a primary role in reaching out objectives. In other words, it is \"defund the police\" on an international level. After circling around the rest of the globe, he lands on China where he simply details their strengths and shows how those will prove to be an enduring advantage over the organization of the US government. This was a big change in the tone of the book because the former examples show countries that we walked into and had a commanding success as per our objectives, or could have if policy was better decided. But for the latter, it shows that we zero advantages or leverage in securing our interests."
