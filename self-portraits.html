SUPER DOUCHE VERSION

William Entriken is an experienced financial professional who understands M&A, business, and technology concepts and goes that extra step to deliver increased sales or process transformations. William is currently a Senior Financial Analyst at a publicly-traded integrated engineering and technology services organization. William has responsibility for the budget and forecasting process & systems for the $1bn company, valuation of business segments, and leading technology initiatives to improve finance processes.

William's formal education includes a three-summer engineering apprenticeship with the U.S. Navy for ship system programming, a B.S. Computer and Electrical Engineering from Villanova, and a M.S. Finance and MBA dual masters from Drexel University.

THE 0XCERT VERSION

William is a remarkable thinker and a technological leader, an Ethereum blockchain developer and the lead author of ERC-721, which is a technological standard interface protocol for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds. He is a passionate computer science professional who is helping to bring technology products to market. He has experience in business planning and acquisitions, and is active in researching several computer science topics. As the Non Fungibles has been identified as the new driver behind the Blockchain revolution, first example of this are everyone’s favorite CryptoKitties, his fame is rising rapidly and has gained on GitHub, home of more than 20 million developers from all over the world, a cult status.

MORE SPEAKER BIOS
- Lead author of ERC-721 / the standard for tracking physical assets on Ethereum. I have studied many practical issues related to tracking and transferring ownership/custody/risk of assets and recording these to a ledger. All relevant projects, to date, have adopted this standard.
- Event organizer of Chain 76 / a conference and hands-on workshop for pharmaceuticals, supply chain, and blockchain. This event focused on drug serialization, GxP, DSCSA, and drew a great audience from Phila/NYC area, including people here. (Thank you!)
- Founder of Su Squares / a scalable blockchain project. This simple project, named after my wife, is a bunch of cute squares that you can buy and personalize. But also it is a project that demonstrates scalable concepts (millions, trillions, sextillions of assets) on the public blockchain.
- Contributor to Solidity / the language used for Hyperledger, POA and Ethereum networks. I contribute to the language design of the programming language used for developing smart contracts.

FRENCH FOUNDERS INTRO
William Entriken advises Arianee, EY and other clients working on enterprise blockchain applications. He is the lead author of the Ethereum standard for tracking physical assets (ERC-721) and he works with a passion for reducing fraud in commerce and improving the value of brands.

ALGO INTRO
Let me introduce my friend William Entriken, who is the author of ERC 721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, an advisor to numerous blockchain projects, a corporate developer, and an entrepreneur.  He took notice of the recent announcement of the COVID App on Algorand and the new details of the Algorand Virtual Machine, he is looking to work with Algorand. He has helped develop and launch the first Blockchain COVID App in Latin America earlier this year, which has government partnerships in Mexico as well as agreements with most laboratories doing COVID-19. GenoBank.io is the first anonymous DNA Test kit with Blockchain which implements secure systems for tracking medical diagnostic testing. It is built on Ethereum and Avalanche. William is exploring the option to move the product to the new Algorand Virtual Machine without impacting any customers. He can also make any standards (Non-fungible tokens) so that other developers can build their own applications on Algorand in a compatible way which will also work with other marketplaces and wallets to be made in the future.

ORIGINS INTRO
A handful of you expressed an interest in learning solidity. The lightbulb went off and I started shopping around for someone reputable to come join Origins to start teaching classes. After a few days of interviews, we landed Will Entriken (@fulldecent).

Will is the lead author of ERC-721 and an entrepreneur with clients that include EY, Arianee, and GenoBank.io. He was a public speaker at numerous large events including NFT.nyc (in 2019 and 2021), DCentral Miami, and the EY Global Blockchain Summit.

Classes will be made available to anyone holding an Origins pass and will take place every Tuesday from 5:00-7:00pm PST / 8:00-10:00pm EST. These will be recorded for those who can't make it.

Though we are still finalizing the rubric and agenda, you can expect the following: 
   - Q&A / Current Events recap (i.e. breaking down the recent adidas hack)
   - The basics of learning how to write smart contracts
   - Deploying a dapp
   - ...and maybe some homework

I greatly appreciate the community stepping up to ask for these types of things. As is no secret, we're always looking to push the boundaries of what is possible. 

Thanks again!

SUCCESSFUL OUTREACH FOR ONE CLIENT
I have audited the MLB Crypto Baseball project (now MLB Champions) -- this included 30 findings ranging from advisory to material -- client allows me to say this but has not yet published that report* I reviewed the prerelease version of 0xcert Framework v1 -- client wished to make all issues public so the report is just a listing (attached)* I have reported a vulnerability against Aion (steal any token) -- https://github.com/jennijuju/ATS_CI/pull/2/files* I am an author of ERC-165 and a last-call reviewer of ERC-1167, both used here* Other than blockchain, I am credited with vulnerability findings against: Apple.com store homepage, a stock brokerage, Penna. business tax records. All posted at https://privacylog.blogspot.com. I also published the first zero-day on Slashdot.

FROM A CHAT
过去3年我咨询的顾客在做NFT市场平台、发表和销售。我的顾客（和他们的顾客）包括：Microsoft、EY、Merck、上海BCWF和各种ICO/艺术家。再次我开演讲会和作坊让世界知道什么是NFT和这么用NFT。
这是NFT最初的时候的标准化
谢谢。不是。我是ERC-721的主作者。
